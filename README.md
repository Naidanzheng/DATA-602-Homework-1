## Overview
The health scientists are challenging to find the relationship between cigarettes and child's birth weight. We used the data on births to women in the United States to see how cigarettes would affect child's birth weight, and what the determinations of child's birth weight are.


## Data
The data set bwght.csv contains data on births to women in the United States. Two variables of interest are the infant birth weight in ounces (bwght), and the average number of cigarettes the mother smoked per day during pregnancy (cigs).The data set includes 1,388 columns and 14 varialbes. The average birth weight of the baby when the mother is not a smoker is 119.77 ounces.
